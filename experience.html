								<h3>Competitive Programmer</h3>
								<p>When I was in elementary school, I quickly realized that school math was note for me. I began exploring the world of math competitions, and was involved in the American Math Competitions and MOEMS in middle school. </p>

								<p>After taking an intro to Java programming course the summer before 9th grade, I tried out competitive programming, which had close ties with the topics in competitive math that I was already experienced with.
									One of the most prominent competitions I was involved in was USACO (USA Coding Olympiad), which tested my knowledge on data structures and algorithms with unique contest problems under time pressure.
								</p>

								<h3>Google Code Next</h3>

								<p>Having joined Google's Code Next program in Sophomore year, I attended clubs and workshops taught by Google Engineers. From these clubs, I also got connected with a community of fellow high school STEM enthusiasts too. 
									Now, I'm a software engineer fellow at Headstarter AI, ready to use all my skills to build more projects and be job-ready in the future.</p>
								<hr />

								<h4>Why me?</h4>
								<p>Being a competitive math and competitive programming veteran, I possess the problem-solving skills and the ability to quickly pick up any new languages and frameworks.</p>
